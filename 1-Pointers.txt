Pointers in C
-------------

1) Consider the following C program.
#include <string.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char *temp;
  strcpy(temp, argv[0]);
  return 0;
}

Why is the above code incorrect (i.e., likely to crash)?
The code will crash because when you pass a array to strcpy, you can only pass the array and not one element inside an array. so if you remove [0] the code will run.


2) Consider the following C program.
#include <string.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char temp[9];
  strcpy(temp, argv[0]);
  return 0;
}

A buffer overflow occurs when the program name is 9 characters long
(e.g., "12345.exe"). Why?
The reason why is because of the null character that ends the string is copied in the 10th position that is not allocated

3) Consider the following C program.
#include <string.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char *buffer = "Hello";
  strcpy(buffer, "World");
  return 0;
}

Why does this program crash?
Since we are trying to write the word "World" to the pointer buffer

4) Consider the following C snippet.
void myfunc()
{
  char b[100];
  char *buffer = &b[0];
  strcpy(buffer, "World");
}

Is this correct?  What's a simpler expression for &b[0]?
Yes, it is correct, another way is just making buffer point to b 

5) Consider the following C program.
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  printf("%s %s %s\n", *argv, (*(argv+1)) + 2, *(argv+2));
  return 0;
}

If this code is executed using the following line, what will be the output?
> program1 -n5 abc
Output: program1 5abc

6) Consider the following C program.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
char *myfunc(char **argv)
{
  char buffer[100];
  strcpy(buffer, "hello");
  return buffer;
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char *s = myfunc(argv);
  printf("%s\n", s);
}

What's wrong with this?
The return of buffer does not excist outside its own function
